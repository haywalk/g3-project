# G3 final project

This is a silly little game I made for Goals, Growth, and Grit 120, a mandatory course at my school.

The player controls a G3-themed UFO, and the object of the game is to collect 'wellness items' (water bottles, books, and salads) while avoiding 'bad habits' (Pepsi and Netflix) and 'negativity' (sad faces).

This game was written in Python using the Pygame library.
